# Zelda Style RPG in pygame

* 2D Zelda Style RPG developed using pygame and tile graphics.
* Game was developed as part of [Clear Code Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU1pPzEGrqw&list=PLGUFtX0WQvIfc_tREtSfYcQpDju0YMg93&index=6&t=2678s&ab_channel=ClearCode). 

The code mostly follows the tutorial, however I did put my own flavour on it, such as:
  * Refactored methods to reduce code complexity, and follow clean code principles.
  * Refactored code structure, modulizing for a more organsied development.

Sections I implemmented not in the tutorial:
  * Title Screen Menu ##TODO
  * Leveling # TDOO
  * Game Over Menu

All game assets are stored in the "assets" folder and were sourced from [Clear Code Projects](https://github.com/clear-code-projects/Zelda) under a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license.
